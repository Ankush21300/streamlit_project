The dataset used in the project contains information about various aspects of video games, including their names, platforms, genres, publishers, and sales figures across different regions.

Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The project starts by loading the video game sales dataset from a CSV file and performs preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values in the 'Publisher' column.
Interactive Sidebar: The dashboard features a sidebar that allows users to select different types of analyses, including overview, year-wise analysis, genre-wise analysis, platform-wise analysis, and publisher-wise analysis.
Overview Analysis: Provides a high-level overview of the video game sales data, including total sales, total games released, and total publishers. It also displays basic information about the dataset columns.
Year-wise Analysis: Visualizes the trend of global sales over the years and the number of games released each year using line and bar charts, respectively.
Genre-wise Analysis: Presents insights into the popularity of different game genres through a pie chart and analyzes the sales performance of each genre using a bar chart.
Platform-wise Analysis: Examines the sales performance across different gaming platforms and identifies the best-selling game for each platform.
Publisher-wise Analysis: Highlights the top publishers based on their total global sales and illustrates their contributions to the overall sales through bar and pie charts.
Overall, the project aims to provide valuable insights into video game sales trends and patterns, which can be useful for stakeholders in the gaming industry, including developers, publishers, and marketers, to make informed decisions and strategies. The interactive nature of the dashboard enhances user experience and facilitates data exploration and analysis.
